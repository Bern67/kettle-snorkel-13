## Introduction

As described in the Methods document model results are displayed 
graphically by plotting the modeled relationship between the particular 
variable(s) and the response (with `r opts_jagr("level") * 100`% 
credible intervals) with the 
remaining variables were held constant. In general, 
continuous and discrete fixed variables are held constant at their mean and 
first level values respectively while random variables are held constant at their 
typical values (expected values of the underlying hyperdistributions). Where informative the influence of particular variables is expressed in terms 
of the effect size (i.e., percent change in the response variable) with 
`r opts_jagr("level") * 100`% credible intervals.
